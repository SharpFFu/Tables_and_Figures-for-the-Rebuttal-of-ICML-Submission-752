# Tables_and_Figures-for-the-Rebuttal-of-ICML-Submission-752

This repository is provided solely as supplementary material for the rebuttal of **ICML Submission 752**.

To ensure compliance with the **ICML rebuttal policy** and the **double-blind reviewing requirements**, the repository contains only:

- experimental figures,
- tables,
- and brief descriptive captions / necessary explanatory text directly associated with those figures and tables.

***No additional substantive text, discussion, or identifying information is included.***

In particular, this repository does **not** contain any extra technical write-up, extended argumentation, author-identifying content, or materials beyond what is permitted under the ICML rebuttal guidelines.

## Relevant ICML Policy

> **Anonymity and Links:** Your responses to reviewers should not contain or link to any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. While links are allowed, reviewers are not required to follow them, and links may only be used for figures (including tables) and captions that describe the figure (no additional text).


## Supplementary Figures for the Rebuttal

### Figure S1. ProcGen result (2 seeds)

### Figure S3. Sensitivity analysis for the quantile filtering ratio $\alpha$
![Figure S3](Sensitivity_experiment_of_alpha.png)

*Caption:* Minecraft episodic return under different values of the quantile filtering ratio $\alpha$. Performance is strongest in the small-to-moderate range, with the best result observed near $\alpha=0.005$.

### Figure S4. Sensitivity analysis for the temperature parameter $\beta$
![Figure 4](Sensitivity_experiment_of_beta.png)

*Caption:* Minecraft episodic return under different values of the temperature parameter $\beta$. Performance is strongest around $\beta=1$, while both overly small and overly large values reduce return

## Supplementary Tables

### Table S1. Atari 100k ablation results
*Caption:* Atari 100k ablation results. **HNS** denotes **human-normalized score**, the standard aggregate evaluation metric for Atari 100k. We report it here because it is the benchmark’s conventional metric for cross-game comparison.

| Method | Mean HNS | Median HNS | IQM HNS |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| No Flow (RL only) | 101.2 | 49.5 | 62.1|
| RL + Cons only | 106.5 | 53.0 | 66.4 |
| Flow w/o Value Target | 95.8 | 52.4 | 60.5 |
| Pointwise Value Update | 115.3 | 55.2 | 70.4 |
| VTFM w/o Consistency | 125.0  | 51.0 | 68.5|
| Frozen Flow | 118.2 | 60.1 | 76.2  |
| Full FlowMAP | 127.4 | 65.8 | 85.3 |

### Table S2. BSuite ablation results

*Caption:* BSuite ablation results. Values are reported as mean episodic return averaged over tasks.

| Method | BSuite Mean Return |
|---|---:|
| No Flow (RL only) | 54.2 |
| RL + Cons only | 55.5 |
| Flow w/o Value Target | 53.8 |
| Pointwise Value Update | 61.3 |
| VTFM w/o Consistency | 57.8 |
| Frozen Flow | 65.2 |
| Full FlowMAP | 69.0 |

### Table S3. Computational-cost information

*Caption:* Benchmark-level computational-cost information for the supplementary experiments. Entries are reported as **FlowMAP vs DreamerV3** when the two differ; **a single value indicates that the two settings are the same.**

| Benchmark | Tasks | Replay Ratio | GPU Days (FlowMAP vs DreamerV3) | Model Size | Peak RAM Usage (GB) (FlowMAP vs DreamerV3) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Minecraft | 1 | 32 | 1.5 vs 1.3 | 200M | 250 |
| DMLab | 30 | 32 | 0.5 vs 0.4 | 200M | 245 vs 240 |
| ProcGen | 16 | 32 | 1.2 vs 1.1 | 200M | 320 vs 317 |
| Atari | 57 | 32 | 0.9 vs 0.8 | 200M | 217 vs 210 |
| Atari 100k | 26 | 128 | 0.1 | 200M | 30 |
| BSuite | 23 | 1024 | 0.1 | 200M | 14 |

### Table S5. Benchmark-level dynamic heterogeneity (MDHI)

*Caption:* Benchmark-level dynamic heterogeneity measured in the same meta-state space used by FlowMAP. $H_{\mathrm{ctx}}$ denotes cross-context heterogeneity, $H_{\mathrm{temp}}$ denotes temporal non-stationarity, and $H(\mathcal{B})$ is their normalized average.

|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ProcGen | 0.78 | 0.65 | 0.72 |
